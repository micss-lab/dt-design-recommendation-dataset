# Digital Twin Design Recommendation Dataset

A comprehensive XML-based dataset for digital twin design recommendations. This dataset is used in a framework to provide structured guidance and smart decision-making for Digital Twins design for cyber-physical systems (CPS) and IoT system implementation.

## 📋 Overview

This repository contains a structured dataset for digital twin design recommendations, organized across four main XML files that provide comprehensive guidance for designing, implementing, and deploying digital twin systems. The framework covers architectural patterns, modeling approaches, implementation standards, and goal-oriented capabilities.
